<h1>PROJECTS</h1>
<h2>A little insights about the services that i will be offering too soon </h2>
<font color="white" >With front-running technologies, we utilize established,industry-leading tools to <br>design and create networking and IT infrastructure that will help maximize<br> productivity, reduce operational costs, and mange complex consolidations.<br>
We also have a variety of networking devices such as:<br>
<ul>
<font color="red" ><li>Repeater:</li></font>
This is an electronic device that amplifies the signal it recieves.<br> You can think of it as a device which receives a signal and retransmits <br>it at a higher level or higher power so that the signal can cover longer distances,<br> more than 100 meters for standard LAN cables.<br>
<br>
<font color="red" ><li>Modem:</li></font>
Modems are used to transmit digital signals over analog telephone lines.<br>Thus, digital signals are converted by te modem into analog signals of different<br> frequencies and transmitted to a modem at the receiving location.
<br><br>
<font color="red" ><li>Gateway:</li></font>
Gateways normally work at the transport and session layers of the osi model.<br>Gateways connect two or more autonomous networks, each with its own routing algorithms,<br> protocols, topology, domain name service and network administration procedures and policies.
<br><br>
<font color="red" ><li>Bridge:</li></font>
bridges are used to connect two or more hosts or network segments together.<br>The basic role of bridges in network architecture is storing and forwarding frames<br> between the two segments that the bridge connects.
<br><br>
<font color="red" ><li>Routers:</li></font>
these help transmit packets to their destinations by charting a path through interconnected<br> networking devices.
Also used to divide internal networks into two or more subnetworks.
<font color="red" ><li>Switch</li></font>
</ul>

 I will also be managing the installation and implementation of the above devices <br>at all levels thats for instance, industrial level, institution level and home level<br> at affordable rates with 6 months guarantee after installations.
